# Java 2D Game Engine


This is a personal/passion project built in Java. This was done by following a YouTube tutorial by a YouTuber GamesWithGame, to which almost all the credit goes to. 

> After going through the book about Java the next reasonable thing to do was to implement the knowledge I have gained by following 
> a tutorial done by GamesWithGame on YouTube. The book in question is "Java 7: The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt. In the 
> tutorial there are many different techniques that are used to creat a 2D game Engine. The major focus of creating this Engine will not be
> about those techinques but rather focus on programming in Java. I have tried upgrading some of the code he has written and 
> implement what I have learned from the book. The book in question is "Java 7: The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt (2012).
